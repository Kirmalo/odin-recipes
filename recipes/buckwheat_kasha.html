    <h3><center>Description</center></h3>

    <p>Buckwheat is a superfood that you really should incorporate into your meal plans. It is as versatile as rice, and I enjoy the flavor much more. </p>

    <h3><center>Ingredients</center></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup toasted* buckwheat groats</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups filtered water</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be sure to look for toasted buckwheat. You may have to find this at a European store. If you cannot find toasted buckwheat, you can toast it in a dry skillet over medium heat for 4 minutes. You want the buckwheat to be golden brown.</p>

    <h3><center>Instructions</center></h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and drain the buckwheat.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine buckwheat groats with 1 3/4 cups of water, 1 tbsp of butter, and 1/2 tsp of salt.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer then cover with a lid and simmer on low for 16 minutes. Just like with rice, you should hear hissing while it's cooking and it will get quiet when it's done.</li>
        <li>Do not stir while the buckwheat is cooking.</li>
        <li>Stir in additional butter if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake for 3 
    </ol>
