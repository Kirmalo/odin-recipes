    <p>Beef hearts... The first time I saw one, the large size was intimidating. But, a grilled heart is one of the best selections for the plate. These spicy heart kebabs will do the trick.</p>

    <h3><center>Ingredients</center></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 beef heart</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds or 1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 chipotle peppers</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>About 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><center>Instructions</center></h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place the garlic in the pan and cook until brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Put the cooked garlic in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Toast the cumin in the skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the cumin in the bowl with the garlic and add the chipotle peppers.</li>
        <li>Add the paprika and puree to a paste. Add the vinegars and enough oil to make a thick paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cut beef hearts into strips about 1.5 inches wide. The strips should be about 2 inches long, 1.5 inches wide, and .5 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Weave pieces of meat onto the skewers so that the flat side is exposed to the fire.</li>
        <li>Put the skewers in a glass baking dish and spread the marinade over the meat with a spoon. Cover and marinate 6 to 12 hours, turning several times for full coverage.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to high and oil the grill grate to preven sticking.</li>
        <li>Drain the marinade off the kebabs, and throw out the marinade.</li>
        <li>Grill until brown and cooked through (about 10 minutes).</li> 
        <li>Baste on the grilled side with achiote or olive oil after 3 minutes to keep the meat moist.</li>
        <li>Serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
